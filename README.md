# Dictionary
I have developed this program in Python. For the creation of the dictionary, I specified key-value pairs inside curly braces {} and named them as DATA. Here, each key is a term and its corresponding value is the definition. For getting and printing a definition, I have used the input() function to get user input and then fetched the corresponding value using print(DATA[a]).
